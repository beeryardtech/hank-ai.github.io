Automating Repetitive Human Decisions
<br>
<p>Hank AI, Inc is a Delaware based C-Corporation with headquarters in NC, USA. Hank is in the business of automating repetitive human cognitive tasks. 
Using our proprietary knowledge-transfer system, Hank captures human cognitive reasoning (i.e. decision making). 
Hank learns like humans learn, via a combination of unsupervised learning plus direct knowledge transfer. 
Hank is able to learn faster and with smaller datasets than any competitor on the market.<br><br> 
Want to automate repetitive human cognition? Let Hank Help.
<br><br>
Our initial automation target is medical coding and continuous live auditing. We are working with our medical billing partners to reduce the human capital required to perform these tasks.
